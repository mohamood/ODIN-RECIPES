       <li>  ½ red bell pepper, sliced</li>
     
    </ul>
    <h3>STEPS</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350°F (180°C).</li>
        <li>Make the xawaash: In a medium bowl, combine the cumin,<br>
             coriander, turmeric, cardamom, black pepper,<br>
              cloves, and nutmeg. Set aside.</li>
        <li>Heat a medium oven-safe pan over medium-high heat.<br>
             Add the vegetable oil, onion, tomato, garlic,<br>
              and cinnamon stick. Cook until the onions<br>
               have softened slightly, 5-6 minutes. </li>
        <li>Season with salt, then add the <br>
            vegetable stock cube and cilantro.<br>
             Cook for 1 minute, breaking up the stock cube.</li>
        <li>Reduce the heat to medium,<br>
             then stir in the xawaash and soaked rice.<br>
             Cook for about 3 minutes so rice grains lightly toast.</li>
        <li>Pour in the hot water and increase the heat<br>
            to high to bring to a boil. Cover the pot,<br>
            transfer to the oven, and bake for 20 minutes. <br>
            Check periodically to be sure the rice has enough water</li>
        <li>Remove the cooked rice from the oven and <br>
            drizzle the red and orange food colorings on top.<br>
            Gently mix so there are different colored grains. </li>
        <li>Sprinkle the raisins over the hot rice, cover, and set aside.</li>
        <li>To prepare the topping, mix the potatoes with<br>
            the orange food coloring in a medium bowl (wear gloves to avoid stained fingers!). </li>
        <li> Heat about 1 inch ( 2 cm) of oil in a large heavy-bottomed saucepan.<br>
             Add the potatoes and cook for 5-6 minutes, <br>
             then transfer to a baking sheet lined with paper towels to drain the excess oil.</li>
        <li>In the same oil, fry the onion slices until browned and crispy,<br>
             2-3 minutes. Add the red peppers cooking for an additional minute.<br>
              Drain on paper towels.</li>
        <li> To assemble the rice, transfer the pilaf to a large serving platter.<br>
             Top with the fried potatoes, crispy onions, and red bell peppers.</li>
        <li>Enjoy!<br>
