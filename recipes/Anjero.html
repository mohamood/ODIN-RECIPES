    <h1>SOMALI ANJERO RECIPE</h1>
    <img src="../images/anjeero.jpg" height="400" width="600"><br>
    <h2><b>“Canjeero?!“ I hear you say. “I’ve heard of Injera, but never canjeero, are you sure you’re not confused?”.</b> </h2>
    <p>Very sure! In fact, canjeero (sometimes called anjero, canjeelo,<br>
         lahoh or laxoox); and Injera are cousins.</p>
    <p>Whilst Injera is the famous Ethiopian food and method of eating;<br>
         this is the Somali version, also a staple in Djibouti and Yemen, <br>
         and often found in Israel too.</p>

    <h3>INGREDIENTS</h3>
    <ul>
  <li>1 cup white corn flour</li>
  <li> ½ cup sorghum flour</li>
  <li>1 Tbsp Instant dry yeast</li>
  <li>4 cups self-raising flour</li>
  <li>¼ cup sugar</li>
  <li>1 tsp salt</li>
  <li>4 cups lukewarm water</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>STEPS</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large bowl, mix the white corn meal, sorghum flour, yeast and half of the water,<br>
             making sure it is properly combined. Leave for one hour.</li>
        <li>After one hour add in the self-rising flour and sugar,<br>
             then slowly start adding the remaining water as you mix to get a smooth,<br>
             lump-less texture for your batter.</li>
        <li>The key to achieving the classic anjero taste is fermentation.<br>
            The mix should rest in a warm place to allow the fermentation to take place.<br>
            The minimum time would be a few hours but to achieve a more authentic,<br>
             sour anjero taste, you can let the batter ferment for up to two days.<br>
             For this recipe you can let the batter ferment overnight.</li>
        <li>In a non-stick frying pan on a medium heat, <br>
            ladle the batter mix into the pan according to preferred portion size,<br>
            making sure that the batter spreads fully across the surface of the pan.</li>
        <li>Cover the pan and cook for a few minutes per portion.<br>
            The desired colour is a golden brown,<br>
            and the texture should be spongy with no liquid remaining.</li>
        <li>Plate the pancake and continue process until you each person has around 3 each.</li>
        <li>Refrigerate leftover batter and use for lunch or for tomorrow’s breakfast.</li>
       
    </ol>
